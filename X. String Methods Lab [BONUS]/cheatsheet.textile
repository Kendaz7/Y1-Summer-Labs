h1. String Operations & Functions Cheatsheet

h2. New Terms

|_.New Term|_.Definition|_.Example|
|Backslash|The @\@ symbol that lets us put special characters into strings.|@"Line 1\nLine 2"@ (This ends up looking like ```"Line 1
Line 2"``` because @"\n"@ gives us a "newline")|
|Index|A number that tells us a location in a list or string. We start counting indices from 0.|@"abc"@ @"a"@ has the index @0@, @"b"@ has the index @1@, and @"c"@ has the index @2@.|
|Slicing|Cutting out a piece of a string.|@"hello!"[3:5]@ This splice ends up being @"lo"@, because we include the 3rd index through to (but not including!) the 5th index.|

h2. Code Examples

|_.Code Example|_.Result|_.Description|
|@"i am super excited about coding!".upper()@|@"I AM SUPER EXCITED ABOUT CODING!@|Making all the letters in a string upper case.|
|@"My pUPpY cOOpER is bRoWn COLOREd!".lower()@|@"my puppy cooper is brown colored!@|Making all the letters in a string lower case.|
|@"dESSERT".swapcase()@|@"Dessert@|Making all the upper case letters lower case, and all the lower case letters upper case.|
|@"i love meet".capitalize()@|@"I Love Meet"@|Capitalizing the first letter of each word.|
|@"Five Six Seven Eight".split()@|@["Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight"]@|Split a string into a list of strings, where we split on spaces.|
|@“Once upon a time”.split(“e”)@|@[“Onc”, “upon a tim”]@|Split a string into a list of strings, where we split on the character @"e"@.|
|@len("12345678")@|@8@|Get the length of the string (the number of characters in it).|
|@'My name is "Will"!'@|@'My name is "Will"!'@|Using a different kind of quotation mark so we can use double quotes inside.|
|@"turtle\\shark"@|@"turtle\shark"@|Using a double backslash so that a single backslash appears in the string when we print it.|
|@"Name:\t\tWill\nFavorite Food:\tArugula"@|```Name:          Will
Favorite Food: Arugula```|The @\t@ become tabs, and the @\n@ becomes a newline.|
|@"My favorite number is " + str(16)@|@"My favorite number is 16"@|We can use @str(16)@ to turn 16 into a string. Then we can add it to our sentence @"My favorite number is "@ without getting a @ValueError@|
|@int("2") + 10@|@12@|We can use @int("2")@ to turn "2" into an integer. Then we can add it to our integer @10@ without getting a @ValueError@|
|@"Hi there!"[1]@|@"i"@|We can use square brackets (@[]@) to index into a string. Because we start counting at 0, index number 1 holds the letter @"i"@.|
|@"My name is Claire!"[11:17]@|@"Claire"@|We can use slicing to get a part of a string. The slice @11:17@ means we go from the 11th index to the 17th index--but we don't include the 17th index--so we end up with @"Claire"@.|
