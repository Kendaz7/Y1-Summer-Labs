## Motivation:
- The purpose of this project is to combine and use all concepts we have learned in CS so far in Y1 Summer **in a group setting!**  
- It is also your **first opportunity** to build an **visual program/game** using the **Turtle**!
- Lastly and most importantly, you will learn how to **work in groups**, how to **collaborate**, and **elevate each other**.

## 


## Objectives / Minimum Requirements:
1. **Theme:** your project must get people to think about environment related issues, and create a game to raise awareness about climate change and the environment.
2. Your project/game has to use the following features: 
    - **Turtle**.
    - Keeping Score feature
    - Input/Output (Using `keyboard/mouse listeners`)
3. Define a list of additional features you want to implement.
  



## What We (CS Team) Care About
Things we are looking for:
    - Creativity
    - Code quality
    - Theme
    - Teamwork
    - Fun!
  

Your team can invent an entirely unique project/game, or make a new version of a familiar project/game - for example using your MiniProject or the instructor examples to get started.  There must be something that makes your project original, different, and connected to the theme.



## Challenges: *(Extra)*
*You can pick any/all of these if you like!* In other words, you don't have to do them in order. Additionally, you can come up with your own extra features you would like to include in your game.

1. Reading and writing files
2. Adding minigame(s)
3. Advanced animations
4. Creating multiple levels
